![Me](/assets/images/me.png)

Hi, I'm Petar. I am a software developer based in London.

When I'm not working I am day-dreaming of travelling the world and
owning a little wood workshop. Currently trying to learn Spanish. For
the 5^th^ time.

You can get in touch with me at **pgyurov93** at **gmail** dot **com**\

For my major project I simulated a [Josephson Bifurcation
Amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect) with a side
exploration into the [Nyquist--Shannon Sampling
Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem).

### London School of Economics and Political Science, London (09/2018 - 09/2029)

**Machine Learning Developer** --- C++, dlib, Python

I helped The Big Wild prototype an object detector and landmark detector
for polar bears which is part of a bigger pipeline that will eventually
be able to distinguish individual polar bears using face detection. The
aim is to tackle the difficulties faced in polar bear tracking by
providing a less invasive and less resource consuming alternative.

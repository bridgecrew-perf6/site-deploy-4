      One and a half weeks of format development for the Hungary department. We were put to the task of developing a facebook video format that engages healthy online discussions — because Hungarians are so polarized.

This design challenge had been developed previously in-house and we worked as a group on this task. After seven working days, that is nine calender days there was supposed to be a resu...

      We’re a group of twelve young journalists pressure cooking in an international media organization. There is this examplar thursday afternoon where we present our first radio pieces after four days of learning. Here I list some levels of learning of that week. The list is non-exhaustive and some aspects may only relate to some or one of our group. Each layer describes one aspect of learning we h...

Brett Terpestra has a cli to auto-complete yaml frontmatter but I’m not getting that to work. But Sublime Text can auto-complete text from files within a directory. So I now add tags to jekyll posts before committing to git in Sublime Text where Sublime Text highlights all those files that haven’t been committed yet. Not clean workaround but as a start.

      »Of course I support a fellow Indian worker in retaining their job,« says my friend Shabnam after I ask her about ordering on Gorillaz. Single-handedly she rebuffs shallow critique about ordering at the food delivery.

It is a late evening and being a great host she just virtually went to the kiosk and have somebody bring two more cases of beer. I ask her whether she had already tipped and of c...

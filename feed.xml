There is this examplar thursday afternoon where we present our first radio pieces after four days of learning. Here I list some levels of learning of that week.

      »Of course I support a fellow Indian worker in retaining their job,« says my friend Shabnam after I ask her about ordering on Gorillaz. Single-handedly she rebuffs shallow critique about ordering at the food delivery.

It is a late evening and being a great host she just virtually went to the kiosk and have somebody bring two more cases of beer. I ask her whether she had already tipped and of c...
